# Apify SDK for Python

The Apify SDK for Python is the official library to create [Apify Actors](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors) in Python.
It provides useful features like actor lifecycle management, local storage emulation, and actor event handling.

If you just need to access the [Apify API](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2) from your Python applications,
check out the [Apify Client for Python](https://docs.apify.com/api/client/python) instead.

## Documentation

For usage instructions, check the documentation on [Apify Docs](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/).

## Example

```python
from apify import Actor
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

async def main():
    async with Actor:
        input = await Actor.get_input()
        response = requests.get(input['url'])
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
        await Actor.push_data({ 'url': input['url'], 'title': soup.title.string })
```

## What are Actors?

Actors are serverless cloud programs that can do almost anything a human can do in a web browser.
They can do anything from small tasks such as filling in forms or unsubscribing from online services,
all the way up to scraping and processing vast numbers of web pages.

They can be run either locally, or on the [Apify platform](https://docs.apify.com/platform/),
where you can run them at scale, monitor them, schedule them, or publish and monetize them.

If you're new to Apify, learn [what is Apify](https://docs.apify.com/platform/about) in the Apify platform documentation.

## Creating Actors

To create and run Actors through Apify Console,
see the [Console documentation](https://docs.apify.com/academy/getting-started/creating-actors#choose-your-template).

To create and run Python Actors locally, check the documentation for [how to create and run Python Actors locally](https://docs.apify.com/sdk/python/docs/overview/running-locally).
