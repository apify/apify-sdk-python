To use either of the libraries mentioned below in your Actors,
you can start from the [Start with Python](https://apify.com/templates?category=python) Actor template.

## Requests

The [`requests`](https://requests.readthedocs.io) library is one of the most popular Python libraries for making HTTP requests.

To use it in your Actors, no special configuration is needed.
Just put `requests` in your `requirements.txt` file,
[reinstall dependencies](../overview/running-locally#adding-dependencies) if you're running the Actor locally,
and you're good to go.

```python title="src/main.py"
import requests
from apify import Actor

async def main():
    async with Actor:
        response = requests.get('http://example.com')
        print(response.text)
```

### Using proxies with requests

To use Apify Proxy with `requests`,
you can just generate a proxy URL through [`Actor.create_proxy_configuration()`](../../reference/class/Actor#create_proxy_configuration),
and pass it to `requests` using the [`proxies` argument](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#proxies):

```python title="src/main.py"
import requests
from apify import Actor

async def main():
    async with Actor:
        proxy_configuration = await Actor.create_proxy_configuration()
        proxy_url = await proxy_configuration.new_url()
        proxies = {
            'http': proxy_url,
            'https': proxy_url,
        }

        response = requests.get('http://example.com', proxies=proxies)
        print(response.text)
```

To learn more about using proxies in your Actor with `requests`, check the [documentation for proxy management](../concepts/proxy-management).

## HTTPX

Another very popular Python library for performing HTTP requests is [`HTTPX`](https://www.python-httpx.org/).
Its main advantage over `requests` is the ability to [perform asynchronous HTTP requests](https://www.python-httpx.org/async/),
making it ideal for large-scale, parallel web scraping.

To use it in your Actors, no special configuration is needed.
Just put `httpx` in your `requirements.txt` file,
[reinstall dependencies](../overview/running-locally#adding-dependencies) if you're running the Actor locally,
and you're good to go.

```python title="src/main.py"
import asyncio
import httpx
from apify import Actor

async def main():
    async with Actor:
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as httpx_client:
            # This will perform all the requests in parallel
            http_requests = []
            for i in range(10):
                http_requests.append(httpx_client.get(f'http://example.com/{i}'))

            responses = await asyncio.gather(*http_requests)
            print(responses)
```

### Using proxies with HTTPX

To use Apify Proxy with `httpx`,
you can just generate a proxy URL through [`Actor.create_proxy_configuration()`](../../reference/class/Actor#create_proxy_configuration),
and pass it to `httpx` using the [`proxies` argument](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/latest/user/advanced/#proxies):

```python title="src/main.py"
import httpx
from apify import Actor

async def main():
    async with Actor:
        proxy_configuration = await Actor.create_proxy_configuration()
        proxy_url = await proxy_configuration.new_url()
        async with httpx.AsyncClient(proxies=proxy_url) as httpx_client:
            response = httpx_client.get(f'http://example.com'),
            print(response)
```
