The Apify SDK for Python is the official library for creating [Apify Actors](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors) in Python.

```python
from apify import Actor
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

async def main():
    async with Actor:
        input = await Actor.get_input()
        response = requests.get(input['url'])
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
        await Actor.push_data({ 'url': input['url'], 'title': soup.title.string })
```

## What are Actors

Actors are serverless cloud programs that can do almost anything a human can do in a web browser.
They can do anything from small tasks such as filling in forms or unsubscribing from online services,
all the way up to scraping and processing vast numbers of web pages.

Actors can be run either locally, or on the [Apify platform](https://docs.apify.com/platform/),
where you can run them at scale, monitor them, schedule them, and even publish and monetize them.

If you're new to Apify, learn [what is Apify](https://docs.apify.com/platform/about) in the Apify platform documentation.

## Requirements

The Apify SDK requires Python version 3.8 or above to run Python actors locally.

## Installation

When you create an Actor using the Apify CLI, the Apify SDK for Python is installed for you automatically.
If you want to install it separately, you can install it from its [PyPI listing](https://github.com/apify/apify-sdk-python):

```bash
pip install apify
```

If you are not developing Apify Actors and you just need to access the Apify API from Python,
consider using the [Apify API client for Python](https://docs.apify.com/api/client/python) directly.

## Quick start

### Creating Actors

To create and run Actors through Apify Console,
see the [Console documentation](https://docs.apify.com/academy/getting-started/creating-actors#choose-your-template).

To create a new Apify Actor on your computer, you can use the [Apify CLI](https://docs.apify.com/cli),
and select one of the [Python Actor templates](https://apify.com/templates?category=python).

For example, to create an Actor from the "[beta] Python SDK" template,
you can use the [`apify create` command](https://docs.apify.com/cli/docs/reference#apify-create-actorname).

```bash
apify create my-first-actor --template python-start
```

This will create a new folder called `my-first-actor`,
download and extract the "Getting started with Python" Actor template there,
create a virtual environment in `my-first-actor/.venv`,
and install the Actor dependencies in it.

### Running the Actor

To run the Actor, you can use the [`apify run` command](https://docs.apify.com/cli/docs/reference#apify-run):

```bash
cd my-first-actor
apify run
```

This will activate the virtual environment in `.venv` (if no other virtual environment is activated yet),
then start the Actor, passing the right environment variables for local running,
and configure it to use local storages from the `storage` folder.

The Actor input, for example, will be in `storage/key_value_stores/default/INPUT.json`.

## Actor structure

All Python Actor templates follow the same structure.

The `.actor` directory contains the [Actor configuration](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/actor-config),
such as the Actor's definition and input schema, and the Dockerfile necessary to run the Actor on the Apify platform.

The Actor's runtime dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` file,
which follows the [standard requirements file format](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/).

The Actor's source code is in the `src` folder. This folder contains two important files:
`main.py`, which contains the main function of the Actor,
and `__main__.py`, which is the entrypoint of the Actor package,
setting up the Actor [logger](../concepts/logging)
and executing the Actor's main function via [`asyncio.run()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.run).

<Tabs>
    <TabItem value="main.py" label="main.py" default>
        <CodeBlock language="python">{
`from apify import Actor
${''}
async def main():
    async with Actor:
        Actor.log.info('Actor input:', await Actor.get_input())
        await Actor.set_value('OUTPUT', 'Hello, world!')`
        }</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="__main__.py" label="__main.py__">
        <CodeBlock language="python">{
`import asyncio
import logging
${''}
from apify.log import ActorLogFormatter
${''}
from .main import main
${''}
handler = logging.StreamHandler()
handler.setFormatter(ActorLogFormatter())
${''}
apify_logger = logging.getLogger('apify')
apify_logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
apify_logger.addHandler(handler)
${''}
asyncio.run(main())`
        }</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you want to modify the Actor structure,
you need to make sure that your Actor is executable as a module, via `python -m src`,
as that is the command started by `apify run` in the Apify CLI.
We recommend keeping the entrypoint for the Actor in the `src/__main__.py` file.

## Adding dependencies

Adding dependencies into the Actor is simple.

First, add them in the [`requirements.txt`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/) file in the Actor source folder.

Then activate the virtual environment in `.venv`:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
    <TabItem value="unix" label="Linux / macOS" default>
        <CodeBlock language="bash">{
`source .venv/bin/activate`
        }</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
        <CodeBlock language="powershell">{
`.venv\\Scripts\\activate`
        }</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then install the dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
