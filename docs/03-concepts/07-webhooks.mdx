Webhooks allow you to configure the Apify Platform to perform an action when a certain event occurs.
For example, you can use them to start another actor when the current run finishes or fails.

You can learn more in the [documentation for webhooks](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/webhooks).

## Creating an ad-hoc webhook dynamically

Besides creating webhooks manually in the Apify Console, or through the Apify API,
you can also create [ad-hoc webhooks](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/webhooks/ad-hoc-webhooks)
dynamically from the code of your actor using the [`Actor.add_webhook()`](../../reference/class/Actor#add_webhook) method:

```python title="src/main.py"
from apify import Actor

async def main():
    async with Actor:
        await Actor.add_webhook(
            event_types: ['ACTOR.RUN.FAILED'],
            request_url: 'https://example.com/run-failed',
        )
        raise RuntimeError('I am an error and I know it!')
```

Note that webhooks are only supported when running on the Apify Platform.
When running the actor locally, the method will print a warning and have no effect.

### Preventing duplicate webhooks

To ensure that duplicate ad-hoc webhooks won't get created in a case of actor restart,
you can use the `idempotencyKey` parameter.
The idempotency key must be unique across all the webhooks of a user so that only one webhook gets created for a given value.
You can use, for example, the actor run ID as the idempotency key:

```python title="src/main.py"
from apify import Actor

async def main():
    async with Actor:
        await Actor.add_webhook(
            event_types: ['ACTOR.RUN.FAILED'],
            request_url: 'https://example.com/run-failed',
            idempotency_key: Actor.config.actor_run_id,
        )
        raise RuntimeError('I am an error and I know it!')
```
