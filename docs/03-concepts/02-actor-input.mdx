The Actor gets its [input](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/input) from the input record in its default key-value store.

To access it, instead of reading the record manually,
you can use the [`Actor.get_input()`](../../reference/class/Actor#get_input) convenience method.
It will get the input record key from the Actor configuration,
read the record from the default key-value store,
and decrypt any [secret input fields](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/secret-input).

For example, if an Actor received a JSON input with two fields,
`{ "firstNumber": 1, "secondNumber": 2 }`,
this is how you might process it:

```python title="src/main.py"
from apify import Actor

async def main():
    async with Actor:
        actor_input = await Actor.get_input() or {}
        first_number = actor_input.get('firstNumber')
        second_number = actor_input.get('secondNumber')
        print(f'Sum: {first_number + second_number}')
```
