title: Running webserver in your Actor

import RunnableCodeBlock from '@site/src/components/RunnableCodeBlock';

import WebserverExample from '!!raw-loader!roa-loader!./code/09_webserver.py';

Each Actor run on the Apify platform is assigned a unique hard-to-guess URL (for example `https://8segt5i81sokzm.runs.apify.net`), which enables HTTP access to an optional web server running inside the Actor run's container.

The URL is available in the following places:

- In Apify Console, on the Actor run details page as the **Container URL** field.
- In the API as the `container_url` property of the [Run object](https://docs.apify.com/api/v2#/reference/actors/run-object/get-run).
- In the Actor as the `Actor.configuration.container_url` property.

The web server running inside the container must listen at the port defined by the `Actor.configuration.container_port` property. When running Actors locally, the port defaults to `4321`, so the web server will be accessible at `http://localhost:4321`.

## Example

The following example demonstrates how to start a simple web server in your Actor,which will respond to every GET request with the number of items that the Actor has processed so far:

<RunnableCodeBlock className="language-python" language="python">
    {WebserverExample}
</RunnableCodeBlock>
