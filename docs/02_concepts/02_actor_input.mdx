The Actor gets its [input](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/running/input) from the input record in its default [key-value store](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/key-value-store).

To access it, instead of reading the record manually, you can use the [`Actor.get_input`](../../reference/class/Actor#get_input) convenience method. It will get the input record key from the Actor configuration, read the record from the default key-value store,and decrypt any [secret input fields](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/secret-input).

For example, if an Actor received a JSON input with two fields, `{ "firstNumber": 1, "secondNumber": 2 }`, this is how you might process it:

<RunnableCodeBlock className="language-python" language="python">
    {InputExample}
</RunnableCodeBlock>
