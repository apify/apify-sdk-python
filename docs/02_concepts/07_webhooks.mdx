Webhooks allow you to configure the Apify platform to perform an action when a certain event occurs. For example, you can use them to start another Actor when the current run finishes or fails.

You can learn more in the [documentation for webhooks](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/webhooks).

## Creating an ad-hoc webhook dynamically

Besides creating webhooks manually in Apify Console, or through the Apify API,you can also create [ad-hoc webhooks](https://docs.apify.com/platform/integrations/webhooks/ad-hoc-webhooks) dynamically from the code of your Actor using the [`Actor.add_webhook`](../../reference/class/Actor#add_webhook) method:

<CodeBlock className="language-python">
    {WebhookExample}
</CodeBlock>

Note that webhooks are only supported when running on the Apify platform. When running the Actor locally, the method will print a warning and have no effect.

## Preventing duplicate webhooks

To ensure that duplicate ad-hoc webhooks won't get created in a case of Actor restart, you can use the `idempotency_key` parameter. The idempotency key must be unique across all the webhooks of a user so that only one webhook gets created for a given value. You can use, for example, the Actor run ID as the idempotency key:

<CodeBlock className="language-python">
    {WebhookPreventingExample}
</CodeBlock>
