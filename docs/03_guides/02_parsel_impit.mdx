In this guide, you'll learn how to combine the [Parsel](https://github.com/scrapy/parsel) and [Impit](https://github.com/apify/impit) libraries when building Apify Actors.

## Introduction

[Parsel](https://github.com/scrapy/parsel) is a Python library for extracting data from HTML and XML documents using CSS selectors and [XPath](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/XPath) expressions. It offers an intuitive API for navigating and extracting structured data, making it a popular choice for web scraping. Compared to [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/), it also delivers better performance.

[Impit](https://github.com/apify/impit) is Apify's high-performance HTTP client for Python. It supports both synchronous and asynchronous workflows and is built for large-scale web scraping, where making thousands of requests efficiently is essential. With built-in browser impersonation and anti-blocking features, it simplifies handling modern websites.

## Example Actor

The following example shows a simple Actor that recursively scrapes titles from linked pages, up to a user-defined maximum depth. It uses [Impit](https://github.com/apify/impit) to fetch pages and [Parsel](https://github.com/scrapy/parsel) to extract titles and discover new links.
