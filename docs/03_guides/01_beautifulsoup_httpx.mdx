In this guide, you'll learn how to use the [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) library with the [HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/) library in your Apify Actors.

## Introduction

[BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) is a Python library for extracting data from HTML and XML files. It provides simple methods and Pythonic idioms for navigating, searching, and modifying a website's element tree, enabling efficient data extraction.

[HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/) is a modern, high-level HTTP client library for Python. It provides a simple interface for making HTTP requests and supports both synchronous and asynchronous requests.

To create an Actor which uses those libraries, start from the [BeautifulSoup & Python](https://apify.com/templates/categories/python) Actor template. This template includes the [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) and [HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/) libraries preinstalled, allowing you to begin development immediately.

## Example Actor

Below is a simple Actor that recursively scrapes titles from all linked websites, up to a specified maximum depth, starting from URLs provided in the Actor input. It uses [HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/) for fetching pages and [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) for parsing their content to extract titles and links to other pages.

</RunnableCodeBlock>

## Conclusion

In this guide, you learned how to use the [BeautifulSoup](https://www.crummy.com/software/BeautifulSoup/) with the [HTTPX](https://www.python-httpx.org/) in your Apify Actors. By combining these libraries, you can efficiently extract data from HTML or XML files, making it easy to build web scraping tasks in Python. See the [Actor templates](https://apify.com/templates/categories/python) to get started with your own scraping tasks.
