Learn how to create and run Actors using the Apify SDK for Python.

## Step 1: Creating Actors

To create and run Actors in Apify Console, refer to the [Console documentation](/platform/actors/development/quick-start/web-ide).

To create a new Apify Actor on your computer, you can use the [Apify CLI](/cli), and select one of the [Python Actor templates](https://apify.com/templates?category=python).

For example, to create an Actor from the "[beta] Python SDK" template, you can use the [`apify create` command](/cli/docs/reference#apify-create-actorname).

```bash
apify create my-first-actor --template python-start
```

This will create a new folder called `my-first-actor`, download and extract the "Getting started with Python" Actor template there, create a virtual environment in `my-first-actor/.venv`, and install the Actor dependencies in it.

## Step 2: Running the Actor

To run the Actor, you can use the [`apify run` command](/cli/docs/reference#apify-run):

```bash
cd my-first-actor
apify run
```

This command:

- Activates the virtual environment in `.venv` (if no other virtual environment is activated yet)
- Starts the Actor with the appropriate environment variables for local running
- Configures it to use local storages from the `storage` folder

The Actor input, for example, will be in `storage/key_value_stores/default/INPUT.json`.

## Step 3: Understanding Actor structure

All Python Actor templates follow the same structure.

The `.actor` directory contains the [Actor configuration](/platform/actors/development/actor-config), such as the Actor's definition and input schema, and the Dockerfile necessary to run the Actor on the Apify platform.

The Actor's runtime dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` file, which follows the [standard requirements file format](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/).

The Actor's source code is in the `src` folder. This folder contains two important files:

- `main.py` - which contains the main function of the Actor
- `__main__.py` - which is the entrypoint of the Actor package setting up the Actor [logger](../concepts/logging) and executing the Actor's main function via [`asyncio.run()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.run).

    <TabItem value="main.py" label="main.py" default>
        <CodeBlock language="python">{
`from apify import Actor
${''}
async def main():
    async with Actor:
        Actor.log.info('Actor input:', await Actor.get_input())
        await Actor.set_value('OUTPUT', 'Hello, world!')`
        }</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="__main__.py" label="__main.py__">
        <CodeBlock language="python">{
`import asyncio
import logging
${''}
from apify.log import ActorLogFormatter
${''}
from .main import main
${''}
handler = logging.StreamHandler()
handler.setFormatter(ActorLogFormatter())
${''}
apify_logger = logging.getLogger('apify')
apify_logger.setLevel(logging.DEBUG)
apify_logger.addHandler(handler)
${''}
asyncio.run(main())`
        }</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

If you want to modify the Actor structure, you need to make sure that your Actor is executable as a module, via `python -m src`, as that is the command started by `apify run` in the Apify CLI.
We recommend keeping the entrypoint for the Actor in the `src/__main__.py` file.
