All Python Actor templates follow the same structure.

The `.actor` directory contains the [Actor configuration](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/actor-config),
such as the Actor's definition and input schema, and the Dockerfile necessary to run the Actor on the Apify platform.

The Actor's runtime dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` file,
which follows the [standard requirements file format](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/).

The Actor's source code is in the `src` folder. This folder contains two important files:
`main.py`, which contains the main function of the Actor,
and `__main__.py`, which is the entrypoint of the Actor package,
setting up the Actor [logger](../concepts/logging)
and executing the Actor's main function via [`asyncio.run()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.run).

If you want to modify the Actor structure,
you need to make sure that your Actor is executable as a module, via `python -m src`,
as that is the command started by `apify run` in the Apify CLI.
We recommend keeping the entrypoint for the Actor in the `src/__main__.py` file.
