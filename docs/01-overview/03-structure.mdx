All Python actor templates follow the same structure.

The `.actor` directory contains the [actor configuration](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/actor-config),
including the actor's input and schema and the Dockerfile necessary to run the actor on the Apify Platform.

The actor's runtime dependencies are listed in the `requirements.txt` file,
which follows the [standard requirements file format](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/).

The actor's source code is in the `src` folder. This folder contains two important files:
`main.py`, which contains the main function of the actor,
and `__main__.py`, which is the entry point of the actor package,
setting up the actor [logger](../concepts/logging)
and executing the actor's main function via [`asyncio.run()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.run).

If you want to modify the actor structure,
make sure that your actor is executable as a module, via `python -m src`,
as it is the command started by `apify run` in the Apify CLI.
We suggest keeping the entry point for the actor in the `src/__main__.py` file.
