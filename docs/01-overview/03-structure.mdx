All Python actor templates follow the same structure.

The `.actor` folder contains the [actor configuration](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/development/actor-config),
like the actor's input and schema, and the Dockerfile necessary to run the actor on the Apify Platform.

The actor's runtime dependencies are specified in the `requirements.txt` file,
following the [standard requirements file format](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/).

The actor's source code is in the `src` folder. There are two important files in the folder:
`main.py`, which contains the main function of the actor,
and `__main__.py`, which is the entrypoint of the actor package,
which sets up the actor [logger](../concepts/logging),
and executes the actor's main function via [`asyncio.run()`](https://docs.python.org/3/library/asyncio-runner.html#asyncio.run).

If you want to modify the actor structure,
you need to make sure that your actor will be executable as a module, via `python -m src`,
as that is the command started by `apify run` in the Apify CLI.
We recommend keeping the entrypoint for the actor in the `src/__main__.py` file.
