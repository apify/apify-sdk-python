## Requirements

The Apify SDK requires Python version 3.8 or above to run Python actors locally.

## Creating your first Actor

To create a new Apify Actor on your computer, you can use the [Apify CLI](https://docs.apify.com/cli),
and select one of the [Python Actor templates](https://apify.com/templates?category=python).

For example, to create an Actor from the "[beta] Python SDK" template,
you can use the [`apify create` command](https://docs.apify.com/cli/docs/reference#apify-create-actorname).

```bash
apify create my-first-actor --template python-start
```

This will create a new folder called `my-first-actor`,
download and extract the "Getting started with Python" Actor template there,
create a virtual environment in `my-first-actor/.venv`,
and install the Actor dependencies in it.

## Running the Actor

To run the Actor, you can use the [`apify run` command](https://docs.apify.com/cli/docs/reference#apify-run):

```bash
cd my-first-actor
apify run
```

This will activate the virtual environment in `.venv` (if no other virtual environment is activated yet),
then start the Actor, passing the right environment variables for local running,
and configure it to use local storages from the `storage` folder.

The Actor input, for example, will be in `storage/key_value_stores/default/INPUT.json`.

## Adding dependencies

Adding dependencies into the Actor is simple.

First, add them in the [`requirements.txt`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/) file in the Actor source folder.

Then activate the virtual environment in `.venv`:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
    <TabItem value="unix" label="Linux / macOS" default>
        <CodeBlock language="bash">{
`source .venv/bin/activate`
        }</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
        <CodeBlock language="powershell">{
`.venv\\Scripts\\activate`
        }</CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then install the dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
