## Requirements

The Apify SDK supports Python versions 3.8 and above.
To run Python actors locally, you'll have to have a supported Python version available.

## Creating your first actor

To create a new Apify actor on your computer, you can use the [Apify CLI](https://docs.apify.com/cli),
and select one of the Python actor templates.

<!-- TODO: link the correct actor template -->

For example, to create an actor from the "[beta] Python SDK" template,
you can use the [`apify create` command](https://docs.apify.com/cli/docs/reference#apify-create-actorname).

```bash
apify create my-first-actor --template python-start
```

This will create a new folder called `my-first-actor`,
download and extract the "Getting started with Python" actor template there,
create a virtual environment in `my-first-actor/.venv`,
and install the actor dependencies in it.

## Running the actor

To run the actor, you can use the [`apify run` command](https://docs.apify.com/cli/docs/reference#apify-run):

```bash
cd my-first-actor
apify run
```

This will activate the virtual environment in `.venv` (if no other virtual environment is activated yet),
start the actor, passing the right environment variables for local running,
and configure it to use local storages from the `storage` folder.

The actor input, for example, will be in `storage/key_value_stores/default/INPUT.json`.

## Adding dependencies

Adding dependencies into the actor is simple.

First, add them in the [`requirements.txt`](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/requirements-file-format/) file in the actor source folder.

Then, activate the virtual environment in `.venv`:

<Tabs groupId="operating-systems">
    <TabItem value="unix" label="Linux / macOS" default>
        <CodeBlock language="bash">
            source .venv/bin/activate
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem value="win" label="Windows">
        <CodeBlock language="powershell">
            .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
        </CodeBlock>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Then, install the dependencies:

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
