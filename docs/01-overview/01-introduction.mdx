Apify SDK for Python is the official library to create [Apify Actors](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors) with Python.

```python
from apify import Actor
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import requests

async def main():
    async with Actor:
        response = requests.get('https://apify.com')
        soup = BeautifulSoup(response.content, 'html.parser')
        await Actor.push_data({ 'url': url, 'title': soup.title.string })
```

## What are Apify actors?

Actors are serverless cloud programs that can do almost anything a human can do in a web browser.
From simple tasks like filling out forms or unsubscribing from online services,
to scraping and processing large amounts of web content.

Actors can be run either locally, or on the [Apify Platform](https://docs.apify.com/platform/),
where you can run them at scale, monitor them, create schedules, and even monetize them.

If you're new to Apify, learn [what is Apify](https://docs.apify.com/platform/about) in the Apify Platform documentation.

## Quick start

### Creating actors

To create and run actors through the Apify Console,
please see the [Console documentation](https://docs.apify.com/academy/getting-started/creating-actors#choose-your-template).

To create and run Python actors locally, check the documentation for [how to create and run Python actors locally](./running-locally).

### Guides

Our guides offer insight on integrating the Apify SDK with some of the most popular web scraping libraries,
such as [Requests and HTTPX](../guides/requests-and-httpx),
[Beautiful Soup](../guides/beautiful-soup),
[Playwright](../guides/playwright),
[Selenium](../guides/selenium),
or [Scrapy](../guides/scrapy).
