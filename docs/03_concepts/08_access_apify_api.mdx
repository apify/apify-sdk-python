The Apify SDK contains many useful features for making Actor development easier. However, it does not cover all the features the Apify API offers.

For working with the Apify API directly, you can use the provided instance of the [Apify API Client](https://docs.apify.com/api/client/python) library.

## Actor client

To access the provided instance of [`ApifyClientAsync`](https://docs.apify.com/api/client/python/reference/class/ApifyClientAsync), you can use the [`Actor.apify_client`](../../reference/class/Actor#apify_client) property.

For example, to get the details of your user, you can use this snippet:

<CodeBlock className="language-python">
    {ActorClientExample}
</CodeBlock>

## Actor new client

If you want to create a completely new instance of the client, for example, to get a client for a different user or change the configuration of the client,you can use the [`Actor.new_client`](../../reference/class/Actor#new_client) method:

<CodeBlock className="language-python">
    {ActorNewClientExample}
</CodeBlock>
