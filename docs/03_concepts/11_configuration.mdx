The [`Actor`](../../reference/class/Actor) class gets configured using the [`Configuration`](../../reference/class/Configuration) class, which initializes itself based on the provided environment variables.

If you're using the Apify SDK in your Actors on the Apify platform, or Actors running locally through the Apify CLI, you don't need to configure the `Actor` class manually,unless you have some specific requirements, everything will get configured automatically.

If you need some special configuration, you can adjust it either through the `Configuration` class directly,or by setting environment variables when running the Actor locally.

To see the full list of configuration options, check the `Configuration` class or the list of environment variables that the Actor understands.

## Configuring from code

This will cause the Actor to persist its state every 10 seconds:

<CodeBlock className="language-python">
    {ConfigExample}
</CodeBlock>

## Configuring via environment variables

This Actor run will not persist its local storages to the filesystem:

```bash
APIFY_PERSIST_STORAGE=0 apify run
```
