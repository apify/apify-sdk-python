There are several methods that interact with other Actors and Actor tasks on the Apify platform.

## Actor start

The [`Actor.start`](../../reference/class/Actor#start) method starts another Actor on the Apify platform, and immediately returns the details of the started Actor run.

## Actor call

The [`Actor.call`](../../reference/class/Actor#call) method starts another Actor on the Apify platform, and waits for the started Actor run to finish.

## Actor call task

The [`Actor.call_task`](../../reference/class/Actor#call_task) method starts an [Actor task](https://docs.apify.com/platform/actors/tasks) on the Apify platform, and waits for the started Actor run to finish.

## Actor metamorph

The [`Actor.metamorph`](../../reference/class/Actor#metamorph) operation transforms an Actor run into a run of another Actor with a new input. This feature is useful if you want to use another Actor to finish the work of your current Actor, instead of internally starting a new Actor run and waiting for its finish. With metamorph, you can easily create new Actors on top of existing ones, and give your users nicer input structure and user interface for the final Actor. For the users of your Actors, the metamorph operation is completely transparent; they will just see your Actor got the work done.

Internally, the system stops the container corresponding to the original Actor run and starts a new container using a different container image. All the default storages are preserved,and the new Actor input is stored under the `INPUT-METAMORPH-1` key in the same default key-value store.

To make you Actor compatible with the metamorph operation, use [`Actor.get_input`](../../reference/class/Actor#get_input) instead of [`Actor.get_value('INPUT')`](../../reference/class/Actor#get_value) to read your Actor input. This method will fetch the input using the right key in a case of metamorphed run.

For example, imagine you have an Actor that accepts a hotel URL on input, and then internally uses the [`apify/web-scraper`](https://apify.com/apify/web-scraper) public Actor to scrape all the hotel reviews. The metamorphing code would look as follows:
