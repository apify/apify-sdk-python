The `Actor` class provides methods to work either with the default storages of the Actor, or with any other storage, named or unnamed.

## Types of storages

There are three types of storages available to Actors.

First are [datasets](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/dataset), which are append-only tables for storing the results of your Actors. You can open a dataset through the [`Actor.open_dataset`](../../reference/class/Actor#open_dataset) method, and work with it through the resulting [`Dataset`](../../reference/class/Dataset) class instance.

Next there are [key-value stores](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/key-value-store), which function as a read/write storage for storing file-like objects, typically the Actor state or binary results. You can open a key-value store through the [`Actor.open_key_value_store`](../../reference/class/Actor#open_key_value_store) method, and work with it through the resulting [`KeyValueStore`](../../reference/class/KeyValueStore) class instance.

Finally, there are [request queues](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/request-queue). These are queues into which you can put the URLs you want to scrape, and from which the Actor can dequeue them and process them. You can open a request queue through the [`Actor.open_request_queue`](../../reference/class/Actor#open_request_queue) method, and work with it through the resulting [`RequestQueue`](../../reference/class/RequestQueue) class instance.

Each Actor run has its default dataset, default key-value store and default request queue.

## Local storage emulation

To be able to develop Actors locally, the storages that the Apify platform provides are emulated on the local filesystem.

The storage contents are loaded from and saved to the `storage` folder in the Actor's main folder. Each storage type is stored in its own subfolder, so for example datasets are stored in the `storage/datasets` folder.

Each storage is then stored in its own folder, named after the storage, or called `default` if it's the default storage. For example, a request queue with the name `my-queue` would be stored in `storage/request_queues/my-queue`.

Each dataset item, key-value store record, or request in a request queue is then stored in its own file in the storage folder. Dataset items and request queue requests are always JSON files, and key-value store records can be any file type, based on its content type. For example, the Actor input is typically stored in `storage/key_value_stores/default/INPUT.json`.

### Local storage persistence

By default, the storage contents are persisted across multiple Actor runs. To clean up the Actor storages before the running the Actor, use the `--purge` flag of the [`apify run`](https://docs.apify.com/cli/docs/reference#apify-run) command of the Apify CLI.

```bash
apify run --purge
```

## Convenience methods for working with default storages

There are several methods for directly working with the default key-value store or default dataset of the Actor.

- [`Actor.get_value('my-record')`](../../reference/class/Actor#get_value) reads a record from the default key-value store of the Actor.
- [`Actor.set_value('my-record', 'my-value')`](../../reference/class/Actor#set_value) saves a new value to the record in the default key-value store.
- [`Actor.get_input`](../../reference/class/Actor#get_input) reads the Actor input from the default key-value store of the Actor.
- [`Actor.push_data([{'result': 'Hello, world!'}, ...])`](../../reference/class/Actor#push_data) saves results to the default dataset of the Actor.

## Opening named and unnamed storages

The [`Actor.open_dataset`](../../reference/class/Actor#open_dataset), [`Actor.open_key_value_store`](../../reference/class/Actor#open_key_value_store) and [`Actor.open_request_queue`](../../reference/class/Actor#open_request_queue) methods can be used to open any storage for reading and writing. You can either use them without arguments to open the default storages, or you can pass a storage ID or name to open another storage.

## Deleting storages

To delete a storage, you can use the [`Dataset.drop`](../../reference/class/Dataset#drop),
[`KeyValueStore.drop`](../../reference/class/KeyValueStore#drop) or [`RequestQueue.drop`](../../reference/class/RequestQueue#drop) methods.

## Working with datasets

In this section we will show you how to work with [datasets](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/dataset).

### Reading & writing items

To write data into a dataset, you can use the [`Dataset.push_data`](../../reference/class/Dataset#push_data) method.

To read data from a dataset, you can use the [`Dataset.get_data`](../../reference/class/Dataset#get_data) method.

To get an iterator of the data, you can use the [`Dataset.iterate_items`](../../reference/class/Dataset#iterate_items) method.

<CodeBlock className="language-python">
    {DatasetReadWriteExample}
</CodeBlock>

### Exporting items

You can also export the dataset items into a key-value store, as either a CSV or a JSON record,
using the [`Dataset.export_to_csv`](../../reference/class/Dataset#export_to_csv)
or [`Dataset.export_to_json`](../../reference/class/Dataset#export_to_json) method.

## Working with key-value stores

In this section we will show you how to work with [key-value stores](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/key-value-store).

### Reading and writing records

To read records from a key-value store, you can use the [`KeyValueStore.get_value`](../../reference/class/KeyValueStore#get_value) method.

To write records into a key-value store, you can use the [`KeyValueStore.set_value`](../../reference/class/KeyValueStore#set_value) method.
You can set the content type of a record with the `content_type` argument.
To delete a record, set its value to `None`.

<CodeBlock className="language-python">
    {KvsReadWriteExample}
</CodeBlock>

### Iterating keys

To get an iterator of the key-value store record keys,
you can use the [`KeyValueStore.iterate_keys`](../../reference/class/KeyValueStore#iterate_keys) method.

<CodeBlock className="language-python">
    {KvsIteratingExample}
</CodeBlock>

### Public URLs of records

To get a publicly accessible URL of a key-value store record,
you can use the [`KeyValueStore.get_public_url`](../../reference/class/KeyValueStore#get_public_url) method.

<CodeBlock className="language-python">
    {KvsPublicRecordExample}
</CodeBlock>

## Working with request queues

In this section we will show you how to work with [request queues](https://docs.apify.com/platform/storage/request-queue).

### Adding requests to a queue

To add a request into the queue, you can use the [`RequestQueue.add_request`](../../reference/class/RequestQueue#add_request) method.

You can use the `forefront` boolean argument to specify whether the request should go to the beginning of the queue, or to the end.

You can use the `unique_key` of the request to uniquely identify a request. If you try to add more requests with the same unique key, only the first one will be added.

Check out the [`Request`](../../reference/class/Request) for more information on how to create requests and what properties they have.

### Reading requests

To fetch the next request from the queue for processing, you can use the [`RequestQueue.fetch_next_request`](../../reference/class/RequestQueue#fetch_next_request) method.

To get info about a specific request from the queue, you can use the [`RequestQueue.get_request`](../../reference/class/RequestQueue#get_request) method.

### Handling requests

To mark a request as handled, you can use the [`RequestQueue.mark_request_as_handled`](../../reference/class/RequestQueue#mark_request_as_handled) method.

To mark a request as not handled, so that it gets retried, you can use the [`RequestQueue.reclaim_request`](../../reference/class/RequestQueue#reclaim_request) method.

To check if all the requests in the queue are handled, you can use the [`RequestQueue.is_finished`](../../reference/class/RequestQueue#is_finished) method.
